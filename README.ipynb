    "-----\n",
    "This package contains the implementation of the mix-initiative control of a single robot under temporal tasks. The human operator can directly modify the navigation input of the robot and assign new tasks to the robot during run time. The workspace is assumed to be only partially-known and possibly dynamic. More importantly, via this interaction, the robot can learn the human preference for the parameters used in the plan synthesis.\n",

    "  Given the past inputs from the human, the robot could learn the preferred value of the parameters used in the plan synthesis. This is closely related to the [inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml00-irl.pdf), where the robot learns about the cost functions of the system model based on demonstration of the preferred plans. On the other hand, in [reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html) problem, the robot learns the optimal plan given these functions.\n",

    "  Most problems of IRL are ill-posed. In order to improve **generalization** such that the robot could infer the human preference based on the human's past inputs (instead of simply repeating them), our solution is based on the [maximum margin planning algorithm](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1143936)."
