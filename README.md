Human-in-the-loop mix initiative control under temporal tasks

Description
-----
This package contains the implementation of the mix-initiative control of a single robot under temporal tasks. The human operator can directly modify the navigation input of the robot and assign new tasks to the robot during run time. The workspace is assumed to be only partially-known and possibly dynamic.
